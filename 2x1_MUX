/* We need registers for the output and we need to assign values. Very similar to how we program in Java but these would be ONE-TIME assignments in Java

What does that mean? In this example, we utilize an If-Else statement in order to indicate the Output of the module.

The 'always' statement takes inputs as its parameters. This specifically is re-running the statement any time one of the parameters changes (such as when we pass values within our test bench module */
