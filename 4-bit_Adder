// Dataflow description of 4-bit adder

   input Cin;
   output [3:0] SUM;
   output Cout;

endmodule

/* Nice feature of this modeling style is the ability to mix Boolean as well as Arithmetic operators 

Our 'assign' statement above simulates a 4-bit adder with very minimal lines of code compared to Gate-Level implementation */
