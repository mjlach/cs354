/* Note our 'always' & 'case' statements this is akin to a 'switch' statement within Java

Again, the 'always' statement re-checks it's parameters for changes and re-executes the 'case' statements checks

Per Markov, it's fine if we code in this manner HOWEVER we must convert to Gate-Level for submissions */
