The ALU, instruction register, and quad multiplexer are described and implemented correctly at gate-level. There is not description or diagram of the control module and its implementation is incorrect (the program works with the original behavioral module). There is no CPU diagram and no description of the instruction set (the test program is shown instead). The test program is compiled correctly and produces the required output.
